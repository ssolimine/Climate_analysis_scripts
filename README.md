# Climate analysis scripts

This repository contains a small sample of scripts from my doctoral research on precipitation variability, deep convection and quasi two-day
westward propagating inertio-gravity (WIG) waves in equatorial Africa.

# Scripts included

Each script contains a header explaining their functionality in more detail

- 'XGBoost_wave_analysis.py' - A supervised machine learning model using XGBoost Regressor for classifying feature importance relative to two-day WIG wave passage
- 'WIG_precipitation_analysis_Congo.py' - Calculates and visualizes precipitation variability associated with two-day WIG waves and their climatology in equatorial Africa
- 'Spatial_lag_regression.py' - Calculates spatial lagged regressions of specific ERA5 variables against two-day WIG filtered cloud top brightness temperatures
- 'Time-height_lag_regression.py' - Calculates time-height lagged regressions of specific ERA5 variables against two-day WIG filtered cloud top brightness temperatures
- 'MSWEP_to_monthly_netcdf.py' - Takes individual 3-hourly MSWEP precipitation data files for specified time period and organizes contents into monthly NetCDF files with a 3-hourly time step
- 'goes16_downloader.py' - Downloads specified GOES-16 satellite imagery products

Sample figures generated by some of the scripts above are stored in the 'figures/' directory. Each subfolder corresponds to the script that generated the plot(s).

# SHAP plot interpretation

The SHAP summary plot illustrates the impact of each input feature (ERA5 variable) on the model’s predictions across all samples. Features are listed on the Y-axis in order of importance. Features near the top have the highest overall impact on the model output. The X-axis represents the SHAP value which shows how much that feature contributed to pushing the prediction higher (right) or lower (left). Each dot represents one datapoint and the color corresponds to the normalized feature value (red = high, blue = low). If red dots are mostly to the right and blue to the left, high values of that feature push the prediction up, and low values push it down. If the spread is symmetric, the feature has a non-directional or complex influence.

# Note

This code is provided as-is for educational and illustrative purposes. Scripts are domain-specific and may not generalize without adaptation to other similar datasets or regions. The Cloud Archive User Service (CLAUS) project dataset was used for the filtering of WIG waves. The datasets used in these scripts were cleaned and pre-processed before use. For example, all ERA5, MSWEP, and CLAUS data were interpolated onto a shared spatial grid in order to make comparisons and accurate statistical calculations across datasets.
